dssg-jupyter: Jupyter Resources for Data Science for Social Good
================================================================

This repository contains some of the materials for a summer code camp 
for middle school students that focuses on data science for social good.
The repository focuses on the Jupyter materials.  (Why Jupyter?  Because
students find it incredibly empowering to know that they are using the
same tools that professionals use.)

The `Data` directory contains sample data.

The `Notebooks` directory contains the sample notebooks.
